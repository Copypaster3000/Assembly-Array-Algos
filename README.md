# Assembly Array Manipulation

## Usage
Each algorithm is contained in its own separate assembly file. To test an individual algorithm, compile only one example file with 'main.c'.

## Compile and Run Example
```bash
gcc -o prog main.c example1.s  
./prog
```

## Overview
The repository contains the following algorithms
- 'example1.s': Returns the length of an array.
- 'example2.s': Finds the largest number in the array.
- 'example3.s': Finds the index of the largest number in the array.
- 'example4.s': Calculates the average value of the array.
- 'example5.s': Reverses the array in place.
- 'example6.s': Sorts the array in ascending order.
Each example is well-commented to explain the operation being performed.

## Purpose of the Project
The primary purpose of this project was to gain a deeper understanding and practical skills in x86-64 assembly language programming. Through this project, I have increased my knowledge of the internal workings of processors, enhanced my problem-solving abilities in a constrained environment, and appreciated the optimization capabilities that assembly language offers.
